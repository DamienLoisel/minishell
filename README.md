# minishell

## Description

The **minishell** project at 42 involves creating a simplified version of a Unix shell. The objective is to build a shell that can execute commands, handle pipes, redirections, and process control. This project helps in understanding system calls, process management, and command parsing in Unix-like systems.

## Features

- **Command Execution**: Execute commands and handle arguments, environment variables, and command paths.
- **Pipes**: Support for piping between commands to pass output from one command to the input of another.
- **Redirections**: Handle input and output redirections using `<` and `>` operators.
- **Process Control**: Implement job control with support for background and foreground processes.
- **Signal Handling**: Handle signals like `SIGINT` (Ctrl+C) and `SIGQUIT` (Ctrl+\) properly.
- **Environment Variables**: Support for setting, unsetting, and using environment variables.
